# Visiting-Card
A basic digital visiting card, created using HTML and CSS.

The feature of this card is that we can share just a link to anyone we want and, on clicking the link the user can visit the various profiles of the card owner.

## The desktop view of the card is shown below:

### Current Features 
The user can click on the icon to visit the LinkedIn and Github profiles of the card owner.

Currently, the card is limited to only two profiles, but we can add as much profiles as we want. For better user experience, we are using minimal and clean UI.
